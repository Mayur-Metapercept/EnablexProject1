EnableX Video Embed now supports Multiple Languages. You can select a language of your choice to be the default language for the Embed. Additionally, you may allow users to choose the language of their choice from the Embed UI.
# Overview
Since the day of release, EnableX Video Embed’s UI was available in the English language only. On April 15, 2022, EnableX introduced support for a few other languages.
# Supported Languages
EnableX Video Embed now can be used in the following languages:

- English
- German
- French
As Video Embed was initially released in English, it remains the default language unless you opt to switch to other languages.
# How to setup?
Language Options setup is done through Portal against the Video Embed Project. Follow these steps:

- Login to the Portal
- Go to Video / Settings
- Go to the Features tab
- Open the Language section.
- In the form:
    - Choose the language that you want to use as your Default Language.
    - Optionally, if you want your users to choose their own language, then you need to check all the languages that you want to make available to your users. Users will get to see the Embed in the default language, however, they will get an option to switch to other available languages if they want to.
