# Raise Hand to talk

Raise Hand Feature is available in Group Meeting mode. This is to maintain decorum in a Video Session. In a large party call, a user simply doesn’t jump in to ongoing debate or conversation to talk. Instead he clicks a button to raise hand to notify others that he is willing to talk. He talks when subsequently a Moderator asks him to talk.

# Speech to Text

Low Code Embed supports Speech to Text feature. User clicks Closed Caption (CC) Button to start receiving Speech to Text of all actively talking users in the video room. The live transcription appears in a scrolling UI towards the bottom of the screen. This is helpful in circumstances where participants have limited language proficiency or they have difficulty in hearing because of a noisy background.

This is subscription based service. If your account is subscribed to this Service, then you get option in the Visual Builder to enable it with your embed.
