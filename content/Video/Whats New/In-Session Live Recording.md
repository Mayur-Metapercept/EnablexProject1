Recording Live refers to a new process of creating a transcoded file in a live session with a custom layout without having to record individual streams. So, using Live Recording has two advantages:
- Obtain a transcoded file within minutes post session. Long wait to obtain transcoded files as per previous transcoding process eliminated.
- Define your layout for the live recording process. Unlike the previous transcoding process, it created a predefined layout.
