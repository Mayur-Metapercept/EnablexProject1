# 100-Way Paged Video
With Active Talkers, each endpoint gets access to Active Talker Streams only. However, many business use-cases require access to other streams available in the room that may not be actively participating in the conversation. Therefore, EnableX introduces a process to allow access to 100 usersâ€™ video streams available in the room.
However, 100-user video play at any endpoint will consume significant bandwidth and will not provide an optimum video communication experience. Therefore, EnableX delivers one set of videos or one page of videos at a time to the requesting endpoint. An endpoint may need to repeatedly request the next set or page of Videos to get access to all 100 user video streams.
