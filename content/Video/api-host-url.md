**API Host URL**

[Sever API Host](https://api.enablex.io/video/)

Every major version release of Server API will have a sub-directory named after the major version number. This is known as Base URL for a Server API Version, for example,

[Version Base URL](https://api.enablex.io/video/v2/)

All Server API Routes are mapped to the Version Base URL, for example:

[Rooms Route URL](https://api.enablex.io/video/v2/rooms)
