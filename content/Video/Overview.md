**Overview**
The Server API is for Server to Server calling only. Therefore, the Application Server can only make Server API Call and all requests from Client End points will be denied.

Some applications may require a provisioning request from the Client End Point using your own service API. Following that, the Application Server can request Enablex Platform using Server API Call and process responses received.
