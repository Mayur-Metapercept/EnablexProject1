A Token is required for any Client End Point to join a RTC session on EnableX Platform.. A Token created for a Room has an assigned role for the user. Note the following:

**Characteristics of Token**
- A Token is created only for a given Room-ID.
- A Token decides your role within a session, i.e. Moderator or a Participant or a Viewer. A Moderator is the Organiser who will have additional control over the session like start/stop recording, hard mute/unmute room, drop/eject participant from the room or end the session. The viewers can access all media streams and chat, but they cannot interact.
- Tokens are transactional. Every time you want to connect to the same room you would require a new Token.
- A Token can be used only once.
- Tokens have a 15 minutes lifetime within which it must be used to connect to a Room.
- For a Permanent Meeting Room, Token may be created any time.
- For a Scheduled Meeting Room, Token may be created 15 minutes prior to scheduled start time.
